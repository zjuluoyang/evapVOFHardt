============
the smooth treatment of surface tension force sigmaK() is not good for the interface. using sigmainterface.k() would be more stable for the interface

This git repository was created Bruno Santos (wyldckat@github working at [blueCAPE Lda](http://www.bluecape.com.pt)), based on the original files that are available here: http://www.ttd.tu-darmstadt.de/forschung_1/openfoamdatenbank/evapvofhard.en.jsp - Quoting from that page:

    Solver for the simulation of two phase flows with phase change (without contact line evaporation) based on Hardt/Wondra (Journal of Computational Physics, 2008).
    In case of further questions please contact M.Sc. Stefan Batzdorf.
    
The original source code was developed for OpenFOAM 2.1.0 and this repository aims to extend functionality to other OpenFOAM versions and variants.

It has been created after finding this thread: http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-programming-development/135891-problem-compiling-new-solver.html

**Please keep in mind that this repository currently only focuses on making the solvers build with each OpenFOAM version. The results from each version have not yet been compared; and there are updates that are present in OpenFOAM's own code that have not been extended to this code.**


Documentation
=============

Have a look into the files `Documentation_evapVOF.pdf` and `example.mpg`.

Changes made that make it work differently from the original source code:

 * The utility `initField` has been renamed to `initFieldVOFHardt`.

 * Both the utility and the solver are now made available at the user's own applications folder, which means that the it's no longer necessary to run with the full path to them.

 * Added the `Allrun`, `Allclean`, `Allwmake` and `Allwclean` scripts for convenience. For example, to run the example case, simply run:
   ```
   ./Allrun
   ```
